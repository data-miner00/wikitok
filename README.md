# wikitok

Tiktok for Wikipedia. Ripoff from [wikitok.net](https://wikitok.net/), inspired by [arxivtok](https://github.com/Miguel07Alm/arxivtok).

## Incentive

Why create the same thing that already exist? It gives me all the control I want as I have a lot of ideas that can make this into something that I would use daily as a medium to explore and learn new stuffs from Wikipedia itself.

## Acknowledgements
